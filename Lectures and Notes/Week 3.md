# Week 3

## Procedural Abstract

1. Local: the implementation of an abstraction does not depend on any other abstraction implementation
2. Substitutable: you can replace one (correct) implementation of an abstraction with another (correct) one, and no callers of that abstraction will need to be modified.

It is CRITICALLY IMPORTANT to get the abstractions right before you start writing code.

### Specification Comments:

1. REQUIRES:（前提条件）
2. MODIFIES:（哪些变量被改变了）A MODIFIES clause identifies any function argument or global state that might change if this function is called.  If the function could change a reference argument, the argument must go in the MODIFIES clause.  Leave it out only if the function can never change it.
3. EFFECTS:(做了什么，改变了什么)
